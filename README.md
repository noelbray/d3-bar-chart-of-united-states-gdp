# D3 Bar Chart Of The United States GDP

*__A D3 bar chart I made of the "United States GDP" for the freeCodeCamp "Bar Chart" challenge.__*

*The code is raw, unrefactored.* Since this was a code challenge I was trying to complete, I didn't delete the commented out code because I was more concerned with learning, experimenting, and completing the challenge than commented out code affecting the code's appearance. 

I also left in the commented out code so that I can:
* keep from trying the same code that didn't work again
* retry it, reuse it
* to experiment with
* generate new ideas from

**Instructions:** 

Hover over any bar to see the date and the Gross Domestic Product for that date. 

**Side Note:** 

If you have any suggestions on how to improve my code; or how I can or what I can do to become a better web developer, feel free to send me a message.
